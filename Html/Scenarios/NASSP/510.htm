<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Apollo
15 was the first of the three Type J missions, consisting of extensive
scientific investigations of the Moon on the lunar surface and from lunar
orbit. It was designed to conduct exploration of the Moon over longer periods,
over greater ranges, and with more instruments for scientific data acquisition
than on previous Apollo missions. Major modifications and augmentations to the
basic Apollo hardware were made. The most significant was the installation of
an instrument module in one of the service module bays for scientific
investigations from lunar orbit. Other hardware changes consisted of LM
modifications to accommodate a greater payload and permit a longer stay on the
lunar surface, the provision of a lunar rover vehicle (LRV), and a scientific
subsatellite to be deployed into lunar orbit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Apollo
15 was launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39, Pad A, at a Range
Zero time of 13:34:00 GMT (09:34:00 a.m. EDT) on 26 July 1971. The planned
launch window for Apollo 15 extended to 16:11:00 GMT to take advantage of a sun
elevation angle on the lunar surface of 12.0°.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Parking
orbit conditions at insertion, 000:11:44.67 (S-IVB cutoff plus 10 seconds to
account for engine tailoff and other transient effects), showed an apogee and
perigee of 91.5 by 89.6 n mi, an inclination of 29.679°, a period of 87.84
minutes, and a velocity of 25,602.6 ft/sec. The apogee and perigee were based
upon a spherical Earth with a radius of 3,443.934 n mi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
international designation for the CSM upon achieving orbit was 1971-063A and
the S-IVB was designated 1971-063B. After undocking at the Moon, the LM ascent
stage would be designated 1971063C, the descent stage 1971-063E, and the
subsatellite 1971 063D.</p>

<h1>Translunar Phase</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>After
inflight systems checks, the 350.71-second translunar injection maneuver
(second S-IVB firing) was performed at 002:50:02.90. The S-IVB engine shut down
at 002:55:53.61 and translunar injection occurred ten seconds later at a
velocity of 35,579.1 ft/sec after 1.5 Earth orbits lasting 2 hours 44 minutes
18.94 seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>At
003:22:27.2, the CSM was separated from the S-IVB stage, transposed, and docked
at 003:33:49.5. The onboard color television camera covered the docking. The
docked spacecraft were ejected from the S-IVB at 004:18:01.2, and an
80.2-second separation maneuver was performed at 004:40:01.8.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Two
minor CSM midcourse corrections were required during translunar flight to
assure proper lunar orbit injection. The first was a 0.8-second maneuver at
028:40:22.0 that produced a change in velocity of 5.3 ft/sec.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
second midcourse correction was performed with the service propulsion system
bank A in order to provide better analysis of an apparent intermittent short.
Because power could still be applied to the valve with a downstream short, bank
A could be operated satisfactorily in the manual mode for subsequent firings.
The redundant bank B system was nominal and could be used for automatic
starting and shutdown.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
scientific instrument bay door was jettisoned at 074:06:47.1. The lunar module
pilot photographed the jettisoned door and visually observed it slowly tumbling
through space away from the CSM and eventually into heliocentric orbit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>At
078:31:46.70, at an altitude of 86.7 n mi above the Moon, the service
propulsion engine was fired for 398.36 seconds, inserting the spacecraft into a
lunar orbit of 170.1 by 57.7 n mi. The translunar coast had lasted 75 hours 42
minutes 21.45 seconds. During the burn, bank A was shut down 32 seconds before
planned cutoff to obtain performance data on bank B for future single bank
burns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Lunar Orbit/Lunar Surface Phase</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>At
082:39:49:09, a 24.53-second service propulsion system maneuver was performed
to establish the descent orbit of 58.5 by 9.6 n mi in preparation for undocking
of the LM. A 30.40-second orbit trim maneuver was performed at 095:56:44.70 and
adjusted the orbit to 60.3 by 8.8 n mi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>During
the 12th lunar revolution on the far side of the Moon at about 100:14, the
CSM/LM undocking and separation maneuver was initiated; however, undocking did
not occur. The crew and ground control decided that the probe instrumentation
LM/CSM umbilical was either loose or disconnected. The command module pilot
went into the tunnel to inspect the connection and found the umbilical plug to
be loose. After reconnecting the plug and adjusting the spacecraft attitude,
undocking and separation were achieved approximately 25 minutes late at
100:39:16.2 at an altitude of 7.4 n mi. A 3.67-second maneuver at 101:38:58.98
circularized the CSM orbit to 65.2 by 54.8 n mi in preparation for the
acquisition of scientific data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
powered descent engine firing began at 104:30:09.4 at an altitude of 5.8 n mi
and ended 739.2 seconds later, just 0.7 seconds before landing at 22:16:29 GMT
(06:16:29 p.m. EDT) on 30 July at 104:42:29.3. The spacecraft landed in the
Montes Apenninus (Apennine Mountains), adjacent to Hadley Rille at latitude
26.13222° north and longitude 3.63386° east, and 1,800 feet northwest of the
planned landing point. Approximately 103 seconds of engine firing time remained
at landing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>At
106:42:49, two hours after landing, the cabin was depressurized and the
commander opened the LM top hatch to photograph and describe the landing site
area. During this “stand-up EVA” (SEVA), which lasted 33 minutes 7 seconds, he
took a series of panoramic photos of the area immediately surrounding the LM
landing site.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
first lunar surface extravehicular activity was initiated at 119:39:17 when the
cabin of the LM was depressurized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>On the
way down the ladder, the commander deployed the modularized equipment stowage
assembly (MESA). The television in the MESA was activated and the pictures of
the commander’s remaining descent to the lunar surface were excellent. The
lunar module pilot then exited to the surface. While the commander removed the
television camera from the MESA and deployed it on a tripod, the lunar module
pilot collected the contingency sample.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>At
120:18:31, the crew offloaded the LRV and deployed it 13 minutes later. They
unstowed the third Apollo lunar surface experiments package (ALSEP) and other
equipment, and configured the LRV for lunar surface operations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>At
121:44:55, the crew drove the LRV to Elbow Crater, collected and documented
samples and gave an enthusiastic and informative commentary on lunar features.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The mission
control center provided television control during various stops. After
obtaining additional samples and photographs near St. George Crater, the crew
returned to the LM using the LRV navigation system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The crew
then proceeded to the selected Apollo lunar surface experiments package
deployment site, 360 feet west-northwest of the LM. There, the experiments were
deployed essentially as planned, except that the second heatflow experiment
probe was not emplaced because drilling was more difficult than expected and
the hole was not completed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The crew
entered the LM and the cabin was repressurized at 126:11:59. The first EVA
lasted 6 hours 32 minutes 42 seconds, about 27 minutes less than planned
because of higher than anticipated oxygen usage by the commander. The distance
traveled in the lunar rover vehicle was 5.6 n mi (10.3 km), vehicle drive time
was 1 hour 2 minutes, parked time was 1 hour 14 minutes, and 31.97 pounds (14.5
kg) of samples were collected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Between
the first and second extravehicular periods, the crew spent 16 hours in the LM.
The second period began at 142:14:48 when the cabin was depressurized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>After
the crew left the LM for the second EVA, they checked out the LRV and prepared
it for the second traverse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The crew
started their traverse at 143:10:43, heading south to the Apennine front, just
east of the first traverse. Stops were made at Spur Crater and other points
along the base of the front, as well as at Dune Crater on the return trip.
Television transmission was very good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
return route closely followed the outbound route. Documented samples, a core
sample, and a comprehensive sample were collected, and photographs were taken.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>After
reaching the LM at 148:32:17, the crew returned to the experiments package site
where the commander completed drilling the second hole for the heat flow
experiment, emplaced the probe, and collected a core tube sample. The drill
core stems were left at the ALSEP site for retrieval during EVA-3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The crew
then returned to the LM and deployed the United States flag. The sample
container and film were stowed in the LM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The crew
entered the LM and the cabin was repressurized at 149:27:02. The second
extravehicular activity period lasted 7 hours 12 minutes 14 seconds. The
distance traveled in the lunar rover vehicle was 6.7 n mi (12.5 km), vehicle
drive time was 1 hour 23 minutes, the vehicle was parked for 2 hour 34 minutes,
and 76.94 pounds (34.9 kg) of samples were collected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The crew
spent almost 14 hours in the LM before the cabin was depressurized for the
third extravehicular period at 163:18:14. The third extravehicular activity
began 1 hour 45 minutes later than planned due to cumulative changes in the
surface activities timeline. Because of this delay and later delays at the
ALSEP site, the planned trip to the North Complex was deleted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
first stop was the ALSEP site at 164:09:00 to retrieve drill core stem samples
left during EVA-2. Two core sections were disengaged and placed in the LRV. The
drill and the remaining four sections could not be separated and were left for
later retrieval.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
third geologic traverse took a westerly direction and included stops at Scarp
Crater, Rim Crater, and “The Terrace” near Rim Crater. Extensive samples and a
double-core-tube sample were obtained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Photographs
were taken of the west wall of Hadley Rille, where exposed layering was
observed. The return trip was east toward the LM with a stop at the ALSEP site
at 166:43:40 to retrieve the remaining sections of the deep-core sample. One
more section was separated, and the remaining three sections were returned in
one piece. During sample collecting, the commander tripped over a rock and
fell, but experienced no difficulty in getting up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>After
returning to the LM, the LRV was unloaded and parked at 167:35:24 for
ground-controlled television coverage of the LM ascent. The commander selected
a site slightly closer to the LM than planned in order to take advantage of
more elevated terrain for better television coverage of the ascent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The crew
reentered the LM and the cabin was repressurized at 168:08:04, thus ending the
fourth human exploration of the Moon. The third extravehicular period had
lasted 4 hours 49 minutes 50 seconds. The distance traveled in the lunar rover

17 was the third Type J mission, an extensive scientific investigation of the
Moon on the lunar surface and from lunar orbit. Although the spacecraft and
launch vehicle were similar to those for Apollo 15 and 16, some experiments
were unique to this mission. It was also the final piloted lunar landing
mission of the Apollo program.</p>

launch countdown proceeded smoothly until 2 minutes 47 seconds before the
scheduled launch, when the Terminal Countdown Sequencer failed to issue the
S-IVB LOX tank pressurization command. As a result, an automatic hold command
was issued at T-30 seconds which lasted 1 hour 5 minutes 11 seconds. The
countdown was recycled to T-22 minutes, but was held again at T-8 minutes to
resolve the sequencer corrective action. This hold lasted 1 hour 13 minutes 19
seconds The countdown was then picked up at T-8 minutes and proceeded smoothly

17 was launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39, Pad A, at a Range
Zero time of 05:33:00 GMT (12:33:00 a.m. EST) on 7 December 1972. The planned
launch window was 02:53:00 GMT to 06:31:00 GMT on 7 December to take advantage
of a sun elevation angle on the lunar surface of 13.3°.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

orbit conditions at insertion, 000:11:52.65 (S-IVB cutoff plus 10 seconds to
account for engine tailoff and other transient effects), showed an apogee and
perigee of 90.3 by 90.0 n mi, an inclination of 28.526°, a period of 87.83
minutes, and a velocity of 25,603.9 ft/sec. The apogee and perigee were based
upon a spherical Earth with a radius of 3,443.934 n mi.</p>

inflight systems checks, the 351.04-second translunar injection maneuver
(second S-IVB firing) was performed at 003:12:36.60. The S-IVB engine shut down
at 003:18:27.64 and translunar injection occurred ten seconds later at a
velocity of 35,555.3 ft/sec after two Earth orbits lasting 3 hours 6 minutes

003:42:27.6, the CSM was separated from the S-IVB stage, transposed, and docked
at 003:57:10.7. During docking, there were indications of a ring latch
malfunction. The LM was pressurized, the hatch removed, and troubleshooting
revealed that the handles for latches 7, 9, and 10 were not locked. All were
manually set and the docked spacecraft were ejected from the S-IVB at 004:45:02.3.
A 79.9second separation maneuver was performed at 005:03:01.1.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
2-hour 40-minute launch delay caused ground controllers to modify Apollo 17’s
trajectory so that it would arrive at the Moon at the originally scheduled
time. They shortened the translunar coast time by having the crew make a
1.73-second 10.5 ft/sec midcourse correction at 035:29:59.91.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
commander and lunar module pilot transferred to the LM at 040:10. At ingress,
it was discovered that #4 docking latch was not properly latched. The command
module pilot moved the latch handle between 30° and 45°, disengaging the hook
from the docking ring. After discussion with ground control, it was decided to
curtail further action on the latch until the second LM activation. The
remainder of the LM housekeeping was nominal and the LM was closed out at
042:11.</p>

second LM housekeeping session commenced at 059:59 and was completed at 062:16.
All LM systems checks were nominal. During the LM housekeeping period, the
command module pilot performed troubleshooting on the docking latch #4 problem experienced
during the first session. Following instructions from the ground controllers,
he stroked the latch handle and succeeded in cocking the latch. The latch was
left in the cocked position for the CSM/LM rendezvous.</p>

were undocked and separated by a 3.4-second maneuver at 107:47:56 at an
altitude of 47.2 n mi, while in an orbit of 61.5 by 11.5 n mi. After undocking,

facets of the Apollo 17 mission were conducted with skill, precision, and
relative ease because of experienced personnel and excellent performance of

data:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:107%'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
Apollo 17 mission was the most productive and trouble-free piloted mission, and
represented the culmination of continual advancements in hardware, procedures,
training, planning, operations, and scientific experiments.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:107%'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
Apollo 17 mission demonstrated the practicality of training scientists to
become qualified astronauts while retaining their expertise and scientific
knowledge.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:107%'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Stars
and the horizon were not visible during night launches, therefore
out-of-the-window alignment techniques could not be used for attitude
reference.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:107%'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
dynamic environment within the cabin during the early phases of the launch made
system troubleshooting or corrective actions by the crew impractical.
Therefore, either the ground control or automation should be relied upon for
system troubleshooting and, in some cases, corrective actions.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in;line-height:107%'>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a
result of problems on this and other missions, further research was needed to
increase the dependability of mechanisms used to extend and retract equipment
repeatedly in the space environment.</p>

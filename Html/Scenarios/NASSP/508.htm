<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Apollo
13 was planned as a Type H mission, a precision piloted lunar landing
demonstration and systematic lunar exploration. It was, however, aborted during
translunar flight because of the loss of all the oxygen stored in two tanks in
the service module.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The crew
members were Captain James Arthur Lovell, Jr. (USN), commander; John Leonard
“Jack” Swigert, Jr. [SWY-girt], command module pilot; and Fred Wallace Haise,
Jr., lunar module pilot. Swigert was backup command module pilot, but Lt.
Commander Thomas Kenneth “Ken” Mattingly, II (USN), the prime command module
pilot, had been exposed to rubella (German measles) by a member of the backup
crew eight days before the scheduled launch date, and results of his
pre-mission physical examination revealed he had no immunity to the disease.
Consequently, on April 10, the day prior to launch, after several days of
intense training with the prime crew, Swigert was named to replace Mattingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
Apollo 13 launch vehicle was a Saturn V, designated SA-508. The mission also
carried the designation Eastern Test Range #3381. The CSM was designated
CSM-109, and had the call-sign “Odyssey.” The lunar module was designated LM-7,
and had the call sign “Aquarius.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Apollo
13 was launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39, Pad A, at a Range
Zero time of 19:13:00 GMT (02:13:00 p.m. EST) on 11 April 1970. The planned
launch window extended to 22:36:00 GMT to take advantage of a sun elevation
angle on the lunar surface of 10.0°.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Due to high
amplitude oscillations in the propulsion/structural system, the S-II center
engine shut down at 000:05:30.64, 132 seconds earlier than planned. The early
shutdown caused considerable deviations from the planned trajectory. The
remaining S-II engines burned 34 seconds longer than planned and shut down at
000:09:52.64.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Despite
the early shutdown of the S-II center engine, parking orbit conditions at
insertion, 000:12:39.83 (S-IVB cutoff plus 10 seconds to account for engine
tailoff and other transient effects), showed a nearly nominal apogee and
perigee of 100.3 by 99.3 n mi, a period of 88.19 minutes, an inclination of
32.547°, and a velocity of 25,566.1 ft/sec. The apogee and perigee were based
upon a spherical Earth with a radius of 3,443.934 n mi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The international
designation for the CSM upon achieving orbit was 1970-029A and the S-IVB was
designated 1970-029B. After undocking prior to Earth entry, the LM would be
designated 1970-029C.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
350.85-second translunar injection maneuver (second S-IVB firing) was performed
at 002:35:46.30. The S-IVB engine shut down at 002:41:37.15 and translunar
injection occurred ten seconds later, after 1.5 Earth orbits lasting 2 hours 29
minutes 7.3 seconds, at a velocity of 35,538.4 ft/sec.</p>

<h1>Translunar Phase</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>At
003:06:38.9, the CSM was separated from the S-IVB stage and onboard television
was initiated at 003:09 for about 72 minutes to show the docking, ejection, and
interior and exterior views of the CM. Transposition and docking with the LM
occurred at 003:19:08.8. The docked spacecraft were ejected from the S-IVB at
004:01:00.8, and an 80.2-second separation maneuver was initiated by the S-IVB
auxiliary propulsion system at 004:18:00.6.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Through
the first 46 hours of the mission, telemetered data and crew observations
indicated that the performance of oxygen tank 2 was normal. At 046:40:02, the
crew routinely turned on the fans in oxygen tank 2. Within three seconds, the
oxygen tank 2 quantity indication changed from a normal reading of about 82
percent full to an obviously incorrect “off-scale high” reading of over 100
percent. Analysis of the electrical wiring of the quantity gauge revealed that
this erroneous reading could have been caused by either a short circuit or an
open circuit in the gauge wiring or a short circuit between the gauge plates.
Subsequent events indicated that a short was the more likely failure mode.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>At
047:54:50 and at 051:07:44, the oxygen tank 2 fans were turned on again, with
no apparent adverse effects. The quantity gauge continued to read off-scale
high.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Following
a rest period, the Apollo 13 crew began preparations for activating and
powering up the LM for checkout. At 053:27, the commander and lunar module
pilot were cleared to enter the LM to commence inflight inspection. A
television transmission of the spacecraft interior started at 055:14 and ended
at 055:46. The crew moved back into the CM and the LM hatch was closed at
055:50.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>At
055:52:31, a master alarm on the CM caution and warning system alerted the crew
to a low pressure indication in the cryogenic hydrogen tank 1. This tank had
reached the low end of its normal operating pressure range several times
previously during the flight. At 055:52:58, flight controllers requested the
crew to turn on the cryogenic system fans and heaters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
command module pilot acknowledged the fan cycle request at 55:53:06, and data
indicated that current was applied to the oxygen tank 2 fan motors at
055:53:20, followed by a power transient in the stabilization control system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>About 90
seconds later, at 055:54:53.555, telemetry from the spacecraft was lost almost
totally for 1.8 seconds. During the period of data loss, the caution and
warning system alerted the crew to a low voltage condition on DC main bus B. At
about the same time, the crew heard a loud “bang” and realized that a problem
existed in the spacecraft.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>When the
crew heard the bang and got the master alarm for low DC main bus B voltage, the
commander was in the lower equipment bay of the command module, stowing the
television camera which had just been in use. The lunar module pilot was in the
tunnel between the CSM and the LM, returning to the CSM. The command module
pilot was in the left-hand couch, monitoring spacecraft performance. Because of
the master alarm indicating low voltage, the command module pilot moved across
to the right-hand couch where CSM voltages could be observed. He reported that
voltages were “looking good” at 055:56:10 and also reported hearing “…a pretty
good bang…” a few seconds before. At this time, DC main bus B had recovered and
fuel cell 3 did not fail for another 90 seconds. He also reported fluctuations
in the oxygen tank 2 quantity, followed by a return to the off-scale high
position.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The commander reported, “…We’re
venting something…into space…” at 056:09:07, followed at 056:09:58 by the lunar
module pilot’s report that fuel cell 1 was off-line. Less than half an hour
later, he reported that fuel cell 3 was also off-line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>When electrical output readings
for fuel cells’ 1 and 3 went to zero, the ground controllers could not be
certain that the cells had not somehow been disconnected from their respective
busses and were otherwise functioning normally. Attention continued to be focused
on electrical problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Five minutes after the accident,
controllers asked the crew to connect fuel cell 3 to DC main bus B in order to
be sure that the configuration was known. When it was realized that fuel cells
1 and 3 were not functioning, the crew was directed to perform an emergency
powerdown to lower the load on the remaining fuel cell. Fuel cell 2 was shut
down at 058:00, followed 10 minutes later by powerdown of the CM computer and
platform.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Observing the rapid decay in
oxygen tank 1 pressure, controllers asked the crew to switch power to the
oxygen tank 2 instrumentation. When this was done, and it was realized that
oxygen tank 2 had failed, the extreme seriousness of the situation became
clear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Several attempts were then made
to save the remaining oxygen in oxygen tank 1, but the pressure continued to
decrease. It was obvious by about 90 minutes after the accident that the oxygen
tank 1 leak could not be stopped and that shortly it would be necessary to use
the LM as a “lifeboat” for the remainder of the mission. The resultant loss of
oxygen made the three fuel cells inoperative. This left the CM batteries,
normally used only during reentry, as the sole power source. The only oxygen
left was contained in a surge tank and repressurization packages used to
repressurize the CM after cabin venting. The LM became the only source of
sufficient electrical power and oxygen to permit a safe return to Earth, and
led to the decision to abort the Apollo 13 mission. By 058:40, the LM had been
activated, the inertial guidance reference transferred from the CSM guidance
system to the LM guidance system, and the CSM systems were turned off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The remainder of the mission was
characterized by two main activities: planning and conducting the necessary
propulsion maneuvers to return the spacecraft to Earth, and managing the use of
consumables in such a way that the LM, which is designed for a basic mission
with two crew members for a relatively short duration, could support three crew
members and serve as the actual control vehicle for the time required.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>A number of propulsion options
were developed and considered. It was necessary to return the spacecraft to a
free-return trajectory and to make any required midcourse corrections.
Normally, the SM service propulsion system would be used for such maneuvers. However,
because of the high electrical power requirements for that engine, and in view
of its uncertain condition and the uncertain nature of the structure of the SM
after the accident, it was decided to use the LM descent engine if possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The spacecraft was then
maneuvered back into a free-return trajectory at 061:29:43.49 by firing the LM
descent engine for 34.23 seconds. It then looped behind the Moon and was out of
contact with the Earth tracking stations between 077:08:35 and 077:33:10, a total
of 24 minutes 35 seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>A 263.82-second transearth injection
maneuver using the LM descent propulsion system was executed at 079:27:38.95 to
speed up the return to Earth by 860.5 ft/sec after the docked spacecraft had
swung around the far side of the Moon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Guidance errors during the
transearth injection maneuver necessitated a 14.0-second transearth midcourse
correction of 7.8 ft/sec, using the descent propulsion system at 105:18:42.0 to
bring the projected entry flight-path angle within the specified limits. During
the transearth coast period, the docked spacecraft were maneuvered into a
passive thermal control mode.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The unprecedented powered-down
state of the CM required several new procedures for entry. The CM was briefly
powered up to assess the operational capability of critical systems. Also, the
CM entry batteries were charged through the umbilical connectors that had
supplied power from the LM while the CM was powered down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Approximately six hours before
entry, the passive thermal control mode was discontinued, and a final midcourse
correction was made using the LM reaction control system to refine the
flight-path angle slightly. The 21.5-second maneuver of 3.2 ft/sec was made at 137:40:13.00.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Less than half an hour later, at
138:01:48.0, the service module was jettisoned, which afforded the crew an
opportunity to observe and photograph the damage caused by the failed oxygen
tank.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The crew viewed the SM and reported
that an entire panel was missing near the S-band high-gain antenna, the fuel
cells on the shelf above the oxygen shelf were tilted, the high-gain antenna
was damaged, and a great deal of debris was exposed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The LM was retained until
141:30:00.2, about 70 minutes before entry, to minimize usage of CM electrical
power. At undocking, normal tunnel pressure provided the necessary force to
separate the two spacecraft. All other events were the same as a normal mission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
Apollo 13 accident was nearly catastrophic. Only outstanding performances by
the crew and ground support personnel, and the excellent performance of the LM
systems made a safe return possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
following conclusions were made from an analysis of post-mission data:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:107%'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
mission was aborted because of the total loss of primary oxygen in the service
module. This loss resulted from an incompatibility between switch design and
pre-mission procedures, a condition which, when combined with an abnormal
premission detanking procedure, caused an inflight shorting and a rapid
oxidation within one of two redundant storage tanks. The oxidation then
resulted in a loss of pressure integrity in the related tank and eventually in
the remaining tank.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:107%'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
concept of a backup crew was proven for the first time when, three days prior
to launch, the backup command module pilot was substituted for his prime crew
counterpart, who was exposed and found susceptible to rubella (German measles).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:107%'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
performance of lunar module systems demonstrated an emergency operational
capability. Lunar module systems supported the crew for a period twice the
intended design lifetime.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:107%'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effectiveness
of pre-mission crew training, especially in conjunction with ground personnel,
was reflected in the skill and precision with which the crew responded to the
emergency.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:107%'>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
the mission was not a complete success, a lunar flyby mission, including three
planned experiments (lightning phenomena, Earth photography, and S-IVB lunar
impact), were completed and data were derived with respect to the capabilities
of the lunar module.</p>

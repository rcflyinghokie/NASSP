the total distance traveled was about 7,600 feet (2.3 km), and the collected samples
totaled 75.73 pounds (34.35 kg, official total in kilograms as determined by
the Lunar Receiving Laboratory in Houston). The farthest point traveled from
the LM was 1,350 feet.</p>

placed the spacecraft into an orbit of 51.93 by 9.21 n mi at 142:10:59.9.
Several rendezvous sequence maneuvers were required before docking could occur
three and a half hours later. A 41.1-second coelliptic orbit maneuver at 143:01:51.0
raised the orbit to 51.49 by 41.76 n mi. A 13.0-second constant differential
height maneuver at 144:00:02.6 lowered the orbit to 44.4 by 40.4 n mi. A
26.0-second terminal phase initiate maneuver occurred at 144:36:26 and brought
the ascent stage to an orbit of 60.2 by 43.8 n mi. Finally, the ascent stage
made a 38.0-second maneuver at 145:19:29.3 to finalize the orbit at 62.3 by
58.3 n mi for docking with the CM at 145:36:20.2 at an altitude of 58.14 n mi.
The two craft had been undocked for 37 hours 42 minutes 17.9 seconds. Good
quality television was transmitted from the CSM for 24 minutes during the final

ascent stage was jettisoned at 147:59:31.6, and the CSM was prepared for
transearth injection. The ascent stage was then maneuvered by remote control to
impact the lunar surface. A 5.4-second maneuver was made at 148:04:30.9 to
separate the CSM from the ascent stage, and resulted in an orbit of 62.0 by
57.5 n mi. An 82.1-second ascent stage deorbit firing was made at 149:28:14.8
at 57.62 n mi altitude. The firing depleted the ascent stage propellants, and
impact occurred at 149:55:17.7, at a point estimated to be latitude 3.42° south

and a question and answer period with scientists and members of the press. It

minutes and 52.0 seconds. Following separation from the CM, the SM reaction control
system was fired to depletion. However, no radar acquisition nor visual
sightings by the crew or recovery personnel were made, and it was believed that
the SM became unstable during the depletion firing and did not execute the
velocity change required to skip out of Earth’s atmosphere into the planned
high-apogee orbit. Instead, it probably impacted before detection.</p>

about 15 g, not only knocked loose portions of the heat shield, but caused the
16 mm sequence camera to separate from its bracket and strike the LMP above the
right eye. Mission duration was 244:36:25. The impact point was about 2.0 n mi

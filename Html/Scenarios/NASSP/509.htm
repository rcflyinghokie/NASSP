<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>At
launch time, a cold front extended through northern Florida. Scattered rain
shower activity existed to the south of this front throughout the morning of
launch, but the showers did not reach the launch area until just before the
scheduled launch time. A band of cumulus congestus clouds with showers developed
about 30 minutes before scheduled launch time along a line extending from
Orlando toward the northern Merritt Island Launch Area (MILA). This, and the
threat of lightning, necessitated a 40 minute 2-second hold at T-8 minutes
until the showers had moved a sufficient distance from the launch complex.
Although it was raining prior to launch, there was no rain at the pad at the
time of launch, but the vehicle did travel through the cloud decks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Apollo
14 was launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39, Pad A, at a Range
Zero time of 21:03:02 GMT (04:03:02 p.m. EST) on 31 January 1971. The planned
launch window was from 20:23:00 GMT on 31 January to 00:12:00 GMT on 1 February
to take advantage of a sun elevation angle on the lunar surface of 10.3°.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Parking
orbit conditions at insertion, 000:11:50.56 (S-IVB cutoff plus 10 seconds to
account for engine tailoff and other transient effects), showed an apogee and
perigee of 100.1 by 98.9 n mi, an inclination of 31.120°, a period of 88.18
minutes, and a velocity of 25,565.8 ft/sec. The apogee and perigee were based
upon a spherical Earth with a radius of 3,443.934 n mi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
international designation for the CSM upon achieving orbit was 1971-008A, and
the S-IVB was designated 1971-008B. After undocking at the moon, the LM ascent
stage would be designated 1971008C and the descent stage 1971-008D.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>After
inflight systems checks, the 350.84-second translunar injection maneuver
(second S-IVB firing) was performed at 002:28:32.40. The S-IVB engine shut down
at 002:34:23.24 and translunar injection occurred ten seconds later, at a
velocity of 35,511.6 ft/sec after 1.5 Earth orbits lasting 2 hours 22 minutes
42.68 seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>At 003:02:29.4,
the CSM was separated from the S-IVB stage. Transposition occurred normally;
however, six docking attempts were required before the CSM was successfully
docked with the LM at 004:56:56.7. The docked spacecraft were ejected from the
S-IVB by a 6.9-second maneuver at 005:47:14.4, and an 80.2-second separation
maneuver was performed at 006:04:01.7. Inflight examination of the docking
probe revealed no problems. It was therefore assumed that the capture latch
assembly must not have been in the locked configuration during the first five
attempts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Translunar
activities included star and Earth horizon calibration sightings in preparation
for a cislunar navigation exercise to be performed during transearth coast, and
dim-light photography of the Earth. A 10.19-second midcourse correction was
made at 030:36:07.91. At 060:30, the commander and lunar module pilot
transferred to the LM for two hours of housekeeping and systems checks. While
there, the crew photographed a wastewater dump from the CM to obtain data for a
particle contamination study being conducted for the Skylab program. A second
midcourse correction, a 0.65-second maneuver, was made at 076:58:11.98 to
achieve the final trajectory desired for lunar-orbit insertion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>At
054:53:36, a clock update was performed to compensate for the weather hold
during the launch countdown. This procedure, which added 40 minutes 20.9
seconds to the mission time clock, was an aid to the command module pilot while
in lunar orbit because it eliminated the need for numerous updates to his
flight log.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>At
081:56:40.70, at an altitude of 87.4 n mi above the Moon, the service
propulsion engine was fired for 370.84 seconds to insert the spacecraft into a
lunar orbit of 169.0 by 58.1 n mi. The translunar coast had lasted 79 hours 28
minutes 18.30 seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>At
086:10:52.97, a 20.81-second service propulsion system maneuver was performed
and established the descent orbit of 58.8 by 9.1 n mi in preparation for
undocking of the LM. On previous missions, the descent orbit insertion maneuver
had been performed with the LM descent propulsion system. Because the landing
site was more rugged than previous ones, a greater margin of LM propellant was
provided.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
commander and lunar module pilot entered the LM at 101:20 to perform system
checks and prepare for undocking. A 2.7-second firing of the service module
reaction control system separated the CM from the LM at 103:47:41.6 and
resulted in an orbit of 60.2 by 7.8 n mi. A 4.02-second maneuver at
105:11:46.11 circularized the CSM to 63.9 by 56.0 n mi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Following
vehicle separation and before powered descent, ground personnel detected the
presence of an abort command at a computer input channel although the crew had
not depressed the abort switch. The failure was isolated to the abort switch,
and to prevent an unwanted abort, a workaround procedure was developed. The
procedure was followed and the 764.61-second powered descent was performed
successfully at 108:02:26.52 at an altitude of 7.8 n mi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Approximately
six minutes after initial actuation of the landing radar, the system switched
to the lowrange scale, forcing the trackers into the narrow-band mode of
operation. This ranging scale problem would have prevented acquisition of radar
data until late in the descent—and prevented a lunar landing —but it was
corrected by cycling the circuit breaker on and off manually.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>LM left
pad surface contact occurred at 108:15:09.3 followed by engine shutdown 1.83
seconds later. The remaining pads touched down at 09:18:13 GMT (04:18:13 a.m.
EST) on 5 February at 108:15:11.4. The spacecraft landed in the Fra Mauro
highlands at latitude 3.64530° south and longitude 17.47136° west, the intended
landing site for Apollo 13. Approximately 68 seconds of engine firing time
remained at landing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Preparations
for the initial period of lunar surface exploration began two hours after
landing, and cabin depressurization began at 113:39:11. The first EVA began 49
minutes late due to intermittent PLSS communications during the EVA
preparations. The cause was believed to have been a LM configuration problem. A
recycling of the audio circuit breaker cleared the problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
commander exited at 113:47. He was followed eight minutes later by the lunar

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The crew
entered the LM and the cabin was repressurized at 118:27:01. The first
extravehicular activity period lasted 4 hours 47 minutes 50 seconds. The

preparation for an excursion to the area of Cone Crater, 0.7 n mi (1.3 km)
east-northeast of the landing site, the crew prepared and loaded the modular
equipment transporter. They experienced difficulties in navigating the slopes
and fell 30 minutes behind schedule. As a result, they only reached a point
within 50 feet (15 m) from the rim of the crater. Nevertheless, the objectives

reentering the LM, the CDR dropped a golf ball onto the surface. Using the head
of a “6-iron” attached to the handle of the contingency sample collector, he
attempted to strike the ball but struck mostly soil and barely moved the ball.
The second swing sent the ball a few feet to the right. He dropped a second
ball which he hit into a crater about 50 feet away. The LMP later threw the

orbit at 61.5 by 58.2 n mi for docking with the CSM at 143:32:50.5 at an
altitude of 58.6 n mi. The two craft had been undocked for 39 hours 45 minutes
8.9 seconds. During the braking phase for docking, telemetry indicated that the
abort guidance system had failed, but no caution and warning signals were on. A
cycling of all circuit breakers and switches did not remedy this condition.
Although no probe/drogue problems were experienced during docking, the probe
was returned to Earth for postflight analysis. Television during rendezvous and
docking was excellent and clearly showed the docking maneuver.</p>

transfer of the crew and samples to the CM, the ascent stage was jettisoned at
145:44:58.0, and the CSM was prepared for transearth injection. The ascent
stage was then maneuvered by remote control to impact the lunar surface. A
15.8-second maneuver was made at 145:49:42.5 to separate the CM from the ascent
stage, and resulted in an orbit of 63.4 by 56.8 n mi. A 76.2-second deorbit
firing at 57.2 n mi altitude depleted the ascent stage propellants, and impact
occurred at 147:42:23.7. The impact point was latitude 3.42° south and
longitude 19.67° west, 36 n mi west of the Apollo 14 landing site, 62 n mi from
the Apollo 12 landing site, and 7 n mi from the target.</p>

Apollo 14, special dust control procedures were used to effectively decrease
the amount of lunar surface dust in the cabins. On previous missions, dust
adhering to equipment being returned to Earth had created a problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>During
transearth coast, a 3.00-second midcourse correction of 0.5 ft/sec was made at
165:34:56.69 using the service module reaction control system. In addition, a
special oxygen flowrate test was performed to evaluate the system for planned
extravehicular activities on subsequent missions, and a navigation exercise
simulating a return to Earth without ground control was conducted using only
the guidance and navigation system. Scientific investigations included
televised demonstrations of electrophoretic separation, liquid transfer, heat
flow and convection, and composite casting under zero-gravity conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The service
module was jettisoned at 215:32:42.2, and the CM followed a normal entry
profile. The command module reentered the Earth’s atmosphere (400,000 feet
altitude) at 215:47:45.3 at a velocity of 36,170.2 ft/sec following a
transearth coast of 67 hours 9 minutes 13.8 seconds. The service module should
have entered Earth’s atmosphere and its debris should have landed in the
Pacific Ocean 650 n mi southwest of the CM splashdown; however, no radar data
or sightings confirmed the entry or impact.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Mission
duration was 216:01:58.1. The impact point was about 0.6 n mi from the target

splashdown, the CM assumed an apex-up flotation attitude. The crew was
retrieved by helicopter and was aboard the recovery ship 48 minutes after
splashdown. The CM was recovered 76 minutes later. The estimated CM weight at
splashdown was 11,481.2 pounds, and the estimated distance traveled for the
mission was 1,000,279 n mi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The crew
and medical support personnel were released from quarantine on 27 February, and
the CM and lunar samples were released on 4 April. The tests showed no evidence
of lunar microorganisms at the three sites explored, and this was considered to
be sufficient justification for discontinuing the quarantine procedures on
future missions.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
Apollo 14 mission was the third successful lunar landing and demonstrated
excellent performance of all contributing elements, thereby resulting in the
collection of a wealth of scientific information. All of the objectives and
experiment operations were accomplished satisfactorily except for some desired
photography that could not be obtained.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
following conclusions were made from an analysis of post-mission data:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:107%'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Cryogenic oxygen system hardware modifications and changes made as a
result of the Apollo 13 failure satisfied, within safe limits, all system
requirements for future missions, including extravehicular activity.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:0in;
line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:107%'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The advantages of piloted space flight were again clearly demonstrated
on this mission by the crew’s ability to diagnose and work around hardware problems
and malfunctions which otherwise might have resulted in mission termination.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:107%'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigation was the most difficult lunar surface task because of problems
in finding and recognizing small features, reduced visibility in the up-sun and
down-sun directions, and the inability to judge distances.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:107%'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Rendezvous within one orbit of lunar ascent was demonstrated for the
first time in the Apollo program. This type of rendezvous reduced the time
between lunar liftoff and docking by approximately two hours from that required
on previous missions. The timeline activities, however, were greatly
compressed.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:107%'>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On previous lunar missions, lunar surface dust adhering to equipment
being returned to Earth had created a problem in both spacecraft. The special
dust control procedures and equipment used on this mission were effective in
lowering the overall level of dust.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:107%'>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Onboard navigation without air-to-ground communications was successfully
demonstrated during the transearth phase of the mission to be sufficiently
accurate for use as a contingency mode of operation during future missions.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:-.25in;
line-height:107%'>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Launching through cumulus clouds with tops up to 10,000 feet was
demonstrated to be a safe launch restriction for the prevention of triggered
lightning. The cloud conditions at liftoff were at the limit of this
restriction and no triggered lightning was recorded during the launch phase.</p>

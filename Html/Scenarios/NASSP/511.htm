inflight systems checks, the 341.92-second translunar injection maneuver
(second S-IVB firing) was performed at 002:33:36.50. The S-IVB engine shut down
at 002:39:18.42 and translunar injection occurred ten seconds later, at a
velocity of 35,566.1 ft/sec after 1.5 Earth orbits lasting 2 hours 37 minutes
32.21 seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>At
003:04:59.0, the CSM was separated from the S-IVB stage, transposed, and docked
at 003:21:53.4. The docked spacecraft were ejected from the S-IVB at
003:59:15.1, and an 80.2-second separation maneuver was performed at
004:18:08.3. Color television was transmitted for 18 minutes during the
transposition and docking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>During
the CSM/LM docking, light colored particles were noticed coming from the LM
area. The particles were unexplained. At 007:18, the crew reported a stream of
particles emitting from the LM in the vicinity of aluminum close-out panel 51,
which covered the Mylar insulation over reaction control system A. This panel
was located below the docking target on the +Z face of the LM ascent stage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>To
determine systems status, the crew entered the LM at 008:17 and powered up. All
systems were normal and the LM was powered down at 008:52. The CM television
was turned on at 008:45 to give the mission control center a view of the
particle emission. In order to point the high gain antenna, panel 51 was
rotated out of sunlight and a marked decrease was then noted in the quantity of
particles. On the television picture, the source of the particles appeared to
be a growth of grass-like particles at the base of the panel. The television
was turned off at 009:06. Results of the investigation determined that the
particles were shredded thermal paint, and that the degraded thermal protection
due to the paint shredding would have no effect on subsequent LM operations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
second LM housekeeping commenced about 053:30 and was completed at 055:11. All
LM system checks were normal. The SM scientific instrumentation module door was

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>LM
activation started at 093:34, about 11 minutes early. The LM was powered up and
all systems were nominal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Lunar
module undocking and separation were performed at 096:13:31. The CSM was
scheduled to perform an orbit circularization maneuver on the 13th lunar
revolution at 097:41:44, but oscillations were detected in a secondary system
that controlled the direction of thrust of the service propulsion system
engine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>While
flight controllers evaluated the problem, the CSM maneuvered into a
stationkeeping situation with the LM and prepared either to redock or continue
the mission. After 5 hours 45 minutes, tests and analyses showed that the
system was still usable and safe; therefore, the vehicles were separated again
and the mission continued on a revised time line. A separation maneuver was
performed at 102:30:00 and the platforms were realigned at 102:40.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>At
103:21:43.08, the service propulsion system was fired for 4.66 seconds to place
the CSM in a lunar orbit of 68.0 by 53.1 n mi in preparation for the
acquisition of scientific data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
734-second powered descent engine firing began at 104:17:25 at an altitude of
10.994 n mi. Landing occurred at 02:23:35 GMT on 21 April (09:23:35 p.m. EST on
20 April) at 104:29:35.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
spacecraft landed in the Plain of Descartes at latitude 8.97301° south and
longitude 15.50019° east, 668 feet north and 197 feet west of the planned
landing site. Approximately 102 seconds of engine firing time remained at
landing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Because
the LM had remained in lunar orbit six hours longer than planned, the LM was
powered down to conserve electrical power and the first extravehicular activity
was delayed in order to provide the crew with a well-deserved sleep period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The LM
cabin was depressurized at 118:53:38 for the first extravehicular activity
period. Television coverage of surface activity was delayed until the LRV
systems were activated because the LM steerable antenna, used for initial lunar
surface television transmission, remained locked in one axis and could not be
used.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>After
completing their activities at the experiments site, the crew drove the lunar
roving vehicle (LRV2) west to Flag Crater where they made visual observations,
photographed items of interest, and collected lunar samples.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
inbound traverse route was just slightly south of the outbound route, and the

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Several
LRV problems occurred during EVA-1. While ascending ridges and traversing very
rocky terrain, there was no response from the rear wheels when full throttle
was applied. The vehicle continued to move, but the front wheels were digging
into the surface.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The crew

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
first extravehicular activity lasted 7 hours 11 minutes 2 seconds. The distance
traveled in the lunar rover vehicle was 2.3 n mi (4.2 km), vehicle drive time
was 43 minutes, the vehicle was parked for 3 hours 39 minutes, and 65.92 pounds
(29.9 kg) of samples were collected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>After 16
hours, 30 minutes in the LM, the crew depressurized the cabin at 142:39:35 to
begin the second extravehicular period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>After
preparing the LRV, the crew headed south-southeast to a mare sampling area near
the Cinco Craters on the north slope of Stone Mountain. They then drove in a
northwesterly direction, making stops near Stubby and Wreck Craters. The last
leg of the traverse was north to the experiments station and the LM.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Later,
at station 8, a rear-drive troubleshooting procedure was implemented. During
this procedure, a mismatch of power mode switching was identified as the cause
of the problem. After a change in switch configuration, the LRV was working
properly. An hour and a half later, at stations 9 and 10, the LRV range,
bearing, and distance were reported to be inoperative. However, navigation
heading was working. When the crew reset the power switches, the navigation
system began operating nominally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>After
the crew arrived at station 10 (LM and ALSEP area), the surface activity was
extended about 20 minutes because the crew’s consumables usage was lower than
predicted. The lunar module pilot then examined the damaged heat flow
experiment. Visual inspection revealed that the cable separated at the
connector. Results of troubleshooting a model of the experiment at mission
control indicated a fix could be accomplished. However it was not attempted
because the time required could affect the third EVA.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
period ended with ingress and repressurization of the LM cabin at 150:02:44.
During ingress, a two-inch portion of the commander’s antenna was broken off,
which produced a 15 to 18 db drop in signal strength. Because the commander’s
backpack radio relayed the lunar module pilot’s information to the LM and the
lunar communications relay unit for transmission to ground stations, a decision
was made later to have the commander use the lunar module pilot’s oxygen purge
system, which supported the antenna.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
second extravehicular activity lasted 7 hours 23 minutes 9 seconds. The
distance traveled in the lunar rover vehicle was 6.1 n mi (11.3 km), vehicle
drive time was 1 hour 31 minutes, park time was 3 hours 56 minutes, and 63.93
pounds (29.0 kg) of samples were collected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The crew
first drove to the rim of North Ray Crater where photographs were taken and
samples gathered, some from House Rock, the largest single rock seen during the
extravehicular activities. The extra 30 minutes were used at North Ray Crater.</p>

427.8-second firing of the ascent engine placed the vehicle into a 40.2 by 7.9
n mi orbit. Several rendezvous sequence maneuvers were required before docking
could occur two hours later. First, a vernier adjustment was made at 175:42:18
at an altitude of 11.2 n mi. Then the terminal phase was initiated with a 2.5
second maneuver at 176:26:05. This maneuver brought the ascent stage to an
orbit of 64.2 by 40.1 n mi. Following a nominal rendezvous sequence, the ascent
stage docked with the CM at 177:41:18 at an altitude of 65.6 n mi, after being

the crew transferred the samples, film, and equipment to the CSM, the ascent
stage was jettisoned at 195:00:12 at an altitude of 59.2 n mi. After jettison,
the LM lost stability and began tumbling at a rate of about 3° per second. This
may have been due to a guidance circuit breaker inadvertently being left open.
A maneuver was made at 195:03:13 to separate the CSM from the ascent stage. No
deorbit burn maneuver was possible, and the ascent stage remained in lunar
orbit for approximately one year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Before
the CSM was maneuvered from lunar orbit, a particles and fields subsatellite
similar to that deployed from Apollo 15 was deployed at 196:02:09 during the
62nd revolution into an orbit of 66 by 52 n. mi. at an inclination of -110°.
The subsatellite was instrumented to measure plasma and energetic-particle
fluxes, vector magnetic fields, and subsatellite velocity from which lunar
gravitational anomalies could be determined. It was scheduled to be released
during the 73rd revolution into an orbit of 170 by 58 n. mi. However, as a
result of the engine gimbal anomaly earlier in the mission, a planned CSM
orbit-shaping maneuver was not performed before ejection of the subsatellite
and the it was placed into an orbit with a much shorter lifetime than planned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>Because
of communications interference resulting from the failure of the ascent stage
to deorbit, it was not possible to activate the subsatellite until 20 hours
after launch. Loss of all tracking and telemetry data occurred at 20:31 GMT on
May 29, 1972. Reacquisition of the signal was expected at 22:00 GMT on that
day, but was not achieved. It is believed that the subsatellite struck the far
side of the lunar surface during the 425th revolution at longitude 110° east.
The lower-than-desired orbit contributed to the short orbital life because the
lunar mass concentrations (“mascons”) on the front and far sides of the Moon
were located near the subsatellite’s ground track.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>The
overall performance of the Apollo 16 mission was excellent, with all of the
primary mission objectives and most of the detailed objectives being met,
although the mission was terminated one day earlier than planned. Experiment
data were gathered during lunar orbit, from the lunar surface, and during both
the translunar and transearth coast phases for all detailed objectives and
experiments except subsatellite tracking for autonomous navigation and the heat
flow experiment. Especially significant scientific findings included the first
photography obtained of the geocorona in the hydrogen (Lyman alpha) wavelength
from outside Earth’s atmosphere, and the discovery of two new auroral belts
around Earth. The following conclusions were made from an analysis of
post-mission data:</p>

</span>Lunar dust and soil continued to cause problems with some equipment,
although procedural measures were taken and equipment changes and additions
were made to control the condition.</p>

</span>Loss of the heat flow experiment emphasized that all hardware should be
designed for loads accidentally induced by crew movements because of vision and
mobility constraints while wearing the pressurized suits.</p>

</span>The capability of the S-band omni-directional antenna system to support
the overall lunar module mission operations was demonstrated after the failure
experienced with the S-band steerable antenna.</p>

line-height:107%'>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The absence of cardiac arrhythmias on this mission was, in part,
attributed to a better physiological balance of electrolytes and body fluids
resulting from an augmented dietary intake of potassium and a better rest-work
cycle that effectively improved the crew’s sleep.</p>

</span>The ability of the crew and the capability of the spacecraft to land
safely in the rough terrain of a lunar highlands region without having high
resolution photography prior to the mission was demonstrated. Further, the
capability of the lunar roving vehicle to operate under these conditions and on
slopes up to 20° was demonstrated.</p>

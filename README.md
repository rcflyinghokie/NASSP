Project Apollo - NASSP (also known as NASSP or formerly NCPP) is an add-on for 
the Orbiter space flight simulator. Project Apollo simulates the Apollo
missions to Earth orbit and the Moon, and is slowly expanding to 
simulate planned post-Apollo missions that never flew. Project Apollo 
features a near-full implementation of the control panels in the Command 
Module and Lunar Module, and an increasingly accurate simulation of the 
internal systems (e.g. electrical distribution, fuel cells). Also the 
Virtual AGC software is supported, which allows you to run precisely the 
same on-board guidance software as used by the real Apollo Guidance 
Computer.

NASSP is intended to be a study simulator, as accurate as possible. 
While there is optional checklist assistance available, no attempt has 
been made to "game-ify" it or make it more accessible at the expense
of realism. Original NASA  software, documentation, and procedures
have been used whenever and wherever possible. Our main goal is
100% accuracy at the systems level. If you want a more user-friendly
or accessible simulation there are plenty of better options,
both for Orbiter and for other platforms.

Orbiter is a Windows program, so this is a Windows-based project. You 
will need Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (or newer) to build the project. 
Until someone ports Orbiter to other platforms (or produces an 
Orbiter-compatible simulator of sufficient capability) there's not much
that can be done about this. Orbiter and NASSP might run under WINE,
but we haven't made ensuring this a project priority.

Releases will be provided as ZIP files to be unzipped into an existing 
Orbiter installation as is usual for Orbiter addons.
